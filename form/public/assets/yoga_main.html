          <div class="contentText">Yoga is a group of physical, mental,and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India. There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Among the most well-known types of yoga are Hatha yoga and Raja yoga.
The origins of yoga have been speculated to date back to pre-Vedic Indian traditions; it is mentioned in the Rigveda, but most likely developed around the sixth and fifth centuries BCE,in ancient India's ascetic movements.The chronology of earliest texts describing yoga-practices is unclear,varyingly credited to Hindu Upanishads.The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali date from the first half of the 1st millennium CE, but only gained prominence in the West in the 20th century.Hatha yoga texts emerged around the 11th century with origins in tantra.</br>

            <div class="contentText"><p>The ultimate goal of Yoga is moksha (liberation), although the exact definition of what form this takes depends on the philosophical or theological system with which it is conjugated.</p><br\>
According to Jacobsen, "Yoga has five principal meanings:<br/><br/>
1.Yoga, as a disciplined method for attaining a goal;<br/><br/>
2.Yoga, as techniques of controlling the body and the mind;<br/><br/>
3.Yoga, as a name of one of the schools or systems of philosophy;<br/><br/>
4.Yoga, in connection with other words, such as "hatha-, mantra-, and laya-," referring to traditions specialising in particular techniques of yoga;<br/><br/>
5.Yoga, as the goal of Yoga practice.
<br /><br/>
      
1.Yoga, is a meditative means of discovering dysfunctional perception and cognition, as well as overcoming it for release from suffering, inner peace and salvation; illustration of this principle is found in Hindu texts such as the Bhagavad Gita and Yogasutras, in a number of Buddhist Mahayana works, as well as Jain texts;<br/><br/>
2.Yoga, as the raising and expansion of consciousness from oneself to being coextensive with everyone and everything; these are discussed in sources such as in Hinduism Vedic literature and its Epic Mahabharata, Jainism Prahamaratiprakarana, and Buddhist Nikaya texts;<br/><br/>
3.Yoga, as a path to omniscience and enlightened consciousness enabling one to comprehend the impermanent (illusive, delusive) and permanent (true, transcendent) reality; examples are found in Hinduism Nyaya and Vaisesika school texts as well as Buddhism Madhyamaka texts, but in different ways;<br/><br/>
4.Yoga, as a technique for entering into other bodies, generating multiple bodies, and the attainment of other supernatural accomplishments; these are, states White, described in Tantric literature of Hinduism and Buddhism;James Mallinson, however, disagrees and suggests that such fringe practices are far removed from the mainstream Yoga's goal as meditation-driven means to liberation in Indian religions.<br/><br/>
White clarifies that the last principle relates to legendary goals of "yogi practice", different from practical goals of "yoga practice," as they are viewed in South Asian thought and practice since the beginning of the Common Era, in the various Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain philosophical schools.</p></div>
